task 2

Investigate the distribution of lot_area. Is the distribution roughly normal? If not, what problems do you find?
```{r}
ggplot(ames) +
  aes(x = lot_area) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white", fill = "steel blue", bins  = 40)
```
This is not a normal distribution, skewing right and is also centrally concentrated.


Task 3.
Compute and visualise a bootstrap sampling distribution for the mean(lot_area) of the sold houses.

```{r}
sample_200 <- ames %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 200, reps = 1000) %>% 
  summarise(
  mean_lot_area = mean(lot_area)
  )
  
  
```

```{r}
#okay, down to business

bootstrap_resample <- sample_200 %>% 
  specify(response = churn, success = "Yes") %>% 
  generate(reps = 5000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "prop")
head(bootstrap_resample)
```
