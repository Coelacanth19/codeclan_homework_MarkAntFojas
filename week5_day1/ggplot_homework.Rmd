# Homework Info

## Learning Objectives<br>

* Practice making plots with ggplot2
* Create your own theme and use it with plots

## Background

QikBit is a start-up company producing low cost fitness trackers. Their flagship product, the KwikBit Unit1 (spot the mistake on the patent form) reproduces the functionality of the best-in-class commercial fitness trackers, but is cheap to make.  They are currently preparing to pitch to a potential investor and require a selection of charts to include in their presentation and promotional materials.

## Data

The data for this assignment is provided in the `CodeClanData` package.

* `qb_revenue_breakdown`
* `qb_monthly_sales`
* `qb_competitors`
* `qb_device_data`

```{r}
#loading libraries
library(CodeClanData)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
#loading data
qb_revenue_breakdown <- qb_revenue_breakdown
qb_monthly_sales <- qb_monthly_sales
qb_competitors <- qb_competitors
qb_device_data <- qb_device_data
col_scheme <- c("Accessories" = "#E89FE9", "Smart Watches" = "#50434F", "Subscription Services" = "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "Trackers" = "#BD7040")
```

Take a little time before you start to familiarise yourself with the data.

# MVP

## Part 1

**Question 1.**  
Take the data in the dataset `qb_revenue_breakdown` and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset.
<br>

```{r}
ggplot(qb_revenue_breakdown) +
  aes(Year, Revenue, fill = Product)+
  geom_col() +
scale_fill_manual(values = col_scheme)
```


**Questino 2.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the "flagship product" - the 'KwikBit Unit 1' - over the last year. This data is inside `qb_monthly_sales`, but you will need to use `filter()` or `subset()` (base `R)`.
<br>
```{r}
  past_year_Kwikbit_monthly_sales <- qb_monthly_sales %>% 
  rename ("Kwikbit_1_Sales" = Amount) %>% 
  filter(Cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales") %>%
  arrange(Date) 
  
  ggplot(past_year_Kwikbit_monthly_sales) +
  aes(Date, Kwikbit_1_Sales, fill = Cashflow) +
  geom_line(colour = "#F9A472")
  
  
```


**Question 3.**  
Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in `qb_monthly_sales`.								
<br>
```{r}
  revenue_and_costs <- qb_monthly_sales %>%
  filter(Cashflow == c("Total Revenue", "Cost")) %>% 
  arrange(Cashflow, Date)
  
  ggplot(revenue_and_costs) +
  aes(Date, Amount, fill = Cashflow, group = Cashflow, colour = Cashflow) +
  geom_line()
  

revenue_and_costs
```


**Question 4.**  
Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot (use `geom_area`). This data is in `qb_competitors`.
<br>
```{r}
qb_competitors %>% 
  group_by(Company) %>% 
  arrange(Year) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(Year, Revenue, fill = Company, colour = Company) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Revenue", labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  geom_area()
```

**Question 5.**  
Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines.
<br>
```{r}
qb_competitors %>% 
  group_by(Company) %>% 
  arrange(Year) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(Year, Revenue, fill = Company, colour = Company) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Revenue", labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
scale_fill_manual(values = col_scheme)
```


**Question 6.**  
Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in `qb_device_data`.
<br>
```{r}


```

## Part 2 

**Question 1.**  
Take the plots that you produced in part one and now polish them by:

1. Adding appropriate labels
2. Changing the scales and coordinates when appropriate.
3. Applying a unified theme, which is described below:
  * Graphs should have white backgrounds, and use colour sparingly.
  * There should be faint grid lines.
  * Font sizes should be ~12pt although titles should be slightly larger and axis labels can be slightly smaller. 
  * All plots should use colours from the following company colour scheme.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("palette.JPG")
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
col_scheme <- c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040")
```
<br>
```{r}
#customizing a prepackaged theme
function (base_size = 11, base_family = "", base_line_size = base_size/22, 
    base_rect_size = base_size/22) 
{
    theme_grey(base_size = base_size, base_family = base_family, 
        base_line_size = base_line_size, base_rect_size = base_rect_size) %+replace% 
        theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", 
            colour = NA), panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, 
            colour = "grey20"), panel.grid = element_line(colour = "grey92"), 
            panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = rel(0.5)), 
            strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey85", 
                colour = "grey20"), legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white", 
                colour = NA), complete = TRUE)
}

```

# Extension

**Question 1.**  
Try out different ways of plotting these three datasets. Which graphs do you think are particularly effective at showing QikBit's success?
