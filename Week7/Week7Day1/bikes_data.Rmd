3 Task hints
You will probably want to use the data in column start_time to create date, month and year columns.
Summarising the data by aggregating hire counts by different measures of time (e.g. year, quarter, month, day) and then visualising the results is probably a good idea
When grouping time series data (tsibble), you need to use index_by instead of group_by

```{r}
nyc_bikes_df %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd_hms(start_time),
         year = year(date),
         quarter = quarters(date),
         month = month(date),
         day = day(date)
         )
```
